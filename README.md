Regions of Interest Maximum Symmetric Surround Saliency Algorithm
============

## Introduction

Detection of visually salient image regions is useful for  applications like object segmentation, adaptive compression and  object recognition. Recently, full-resolution salient maps that  retain well-defined boundaries have attracted attention. In these  maps, boundaries are preserved by retaining substantially more frequency content from the original image than older techniques.  However, if the salient regions comprise more than half the pixels  of the image, or if the background is complex, the background gets  highlighted instead of the salient object.

Maximum Symmetric Surround Saliency is a method for salient region detection that retains the  advantages of full resolution saliency maps with well-defined  boundaries while overcoming their shortcomings. It exploits  features of color and luminance, is simple to implement and is  computationally efficient.
