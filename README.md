Regions of Interest Maximum Symmetric Surround Saliency Algorithm
============

Detection of visually salient image regions is useful for  applications like object segmentation, adaptive compression, and  object recognition. Recently, full-resolution salient maps that  retain well-defined boundaries have attracted attention. In these maps, boundaries are preserved by retaining substantially more frequency content from the original image than older techniques.  However, if the salient regions comprise more than half the pixels of the image, or if the background is complex, the background gets highlighted instead of the salient object.

Maximum Symmetric Surround Saliency is a method for salient region detection that retains the advantages of full resolution saliency maps with well-defined  boundaries while overcoming their shortcomings. It exploits features of color and luminance, is simple to implement and is  computationally efficient.
